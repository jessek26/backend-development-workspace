My name is Jesse Kooyenga. This reposititory will be storing all of my work in my Backend Development course!

My current goals in this course are to

- Get better with JS (I would call myself a novice currently)
- Figure out if I prefer frontend or backend development
- Get better with using Git

I plan to use this repository to track my progress throughout the semester, as well as to review old assignments to make sure I'm retaining the skills I lean.
